# To activate virtual enviornment in RPI
do : 
``` source env/bin/activate```

# Threading 
It lets you run multiple processes at once 
__example:__
```python
import threading  #here
import time
from gpiozero import LED
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO  # This is the rpi-lgpio shim

# Set up gpiozero LED
gpiozero_led = LED(17)

# Set up lgpio LED
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
GPIO.setup(27, GPIO.OUT)

# Define blink functions
def blink_gpiozero():
    while True:
        gpiozero_led.toggle()
        time.sleep(1)

def blink_lgpio():
    state = False
    while True:
        GPIO.output(27, state)
        state = not state
        time.sleep(1)

# Create and start threads
t1 = threading.Thread(target=blink_gpiozero)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=blink_lgpio)

t1.start()
t2.start()  
```

# Intro to gpiod
this is an example code:
```python = numberLines
import gpiod
import time

chip = gpiod.Chip("gpiochip0")
line = chip.get_line(25)
line.request(consumer="my-script", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_OUT, default_vals=[0])

for i in range(5):
    line.set_value(1)
    print("ON")
    time.sleep(0.5)
    line.set_value(0)
    print("OFF")
    time.sleep(0.5)

line.release()
```
Here, `chip = gpiod.Chip("gpiochip0")` says that the RPI will use the chip (which is like the master or dispatcher with all the lines) that it is going to use gpiochip0
I should basically __always__ use gpiochip0 as it is the "master" that controlls all 54 lines
# Lines and how to configure your GPIO pins
## Scinario where all the pins are outputs
lines is basically just the pin. Line 2 would correspond to pin 2in the __BCM__ system. __Remember!!! its in BCM!!!__
- So here in Line 5 where it says `Line = chip.get_line(25)`, it is "fetching" the BCM pin 25

Then below it in line 6, `line.request(consumer="my-script", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_OUT, default_vals=[0])`. This command/function has 3 things written in it. 
- the first part `consumer="my-script"` part is __optional__ but it can help you debug stuff. It basically says that script with the name "my-script" is the one using that gpio pin. to do this, you can Bash: `gpioinfo gpiochip0` and you might see something like `line 25: "my-script" output active-high [used]` which tells you that "my-script" is using pin 25.
- the `type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_OUT` is just saying that line 2 is an output pin. if you want to configure multiple output pins, say "lines" and pick them as a group and set their default states individually :
```python 
lines = chip.get_lines([17, 22, 23])  # GPIO pins to control
lines.request(consumer="my-multiblinker", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_OUT,default_vals=[0, 0, 0])
```
This sets them all to output pins. to change the values of the pins, you can do things like `lines.set_values([1, 0, 1])` which will turn pins 17 and 23 on
- its pretty self explanatory but `default_vals=[0]` sets their default state to 0

## To se Input/Output combinations:
If you only have one line for input/output each, you can declare it individually like this 
```python
import gpiod
import time

chip = gpiod.Chip("gpiochip0")  # Access the main GPIO chip

# üü¢ Request the input line (e.g., button on GPIO 17)
button_line = chip.get_line(17)
button_line.request(consumer="button-reader", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_IN)
# üî¥ Request the output line (e.g., LED on GPIO 22)
led_line = chip.get_line(22)
led_line.request(consumer="led-blinker", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_OUT, default_vals=[0])
```
### when you have multiple inputs/outputs:
You can do something like this:
```python
inputs = chip.get_lines([17, 23])      # Buttons
outputs = chip.get_lines([22, 24])     # LEDs

inputs.request(consumer="buttons", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_IN)
outputs.request(consumer="leds", type=gpiod.LINE_REQ_DIR_OUT, default_vals=[0, 0])
```
You can get their values separately using 
```python
inputs.get_values()
outputs.set_values([1, 0])
```

```
So there are a couple issues here. 
1. I can do `{[XXX], [XXX]}` in line 71 its like a thing with lists. you should just make a "list of lists" like `[(XXX), (xxx)]`
2. thhe whole threading structure is wrong. currently, the `def servo_control()` is set to run concurrently with the rfid scanning code. so the servo will just go to 90 deg, come back once and finish. 
3. since the `uid` term is in `def main()`, a different function that isnt in `main()` can't acess it. 
## queue
to use something in one function in another function/thread, use queue
to start, you need to put `from queue import Queue`
to put stuff in the queue to use later, you do `queue.put(data)`, and to retreive it, do `queue.get()
